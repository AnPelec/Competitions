## Tasks/Solutions from various Programming Competitions

During my high school years, informatics competitions were a very interesting hobby for me. I have devoted a significant part these years into my training and as a result, I have participated in various competitions, both national, international, online and offline!

In this repository I will try to share some of my favorite solutions from varying areas (Dynamic Programming, Mathematics, Data Structures) and in varying levels of difficulty.
